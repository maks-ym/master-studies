TASK

Create a configuration file in which all processes run an average
of 2000 milliseconds with a standard deviation of zero, and which
are blocked for input or output every 500 milliseconds. Run the
simulation for 10000 milliseconds with 2 processes. Examine the
two output files. Try again for 5 processes. Try again for 10
processes. Explain what's happening.
